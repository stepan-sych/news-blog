# News blog, react project

This is my first project to use React JS. The blog of the [TSN](https://tsn.ua/) website is taken
as a basis. Here's how to clone and run a project on your laptop.

1. Open your terminal and then type

`$ git clone {the url to the GitHub repo}`

This clones the repo

2. `cd` into the new folder and type

`$ npm install`

This installs the required dependencies

3. To run the React project.
   `$ npm start`

**You are done!** Now you can start editing
the React project in the new folder that's created.
